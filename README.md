Shloka is a Learning Management System (LMS) that aims to provide interactive learning tools and content. It is a basic bare-bones LMS where teachers can add subjects, chapters and resources for those subjects which will be shown on the portal and students can only view/interact with the content.This LMS has a few built-in interactive features/ learning tools which are listed below.

##Features:
